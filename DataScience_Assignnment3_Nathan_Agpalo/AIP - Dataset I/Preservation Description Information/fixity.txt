The data is sourced directly from Discord itself. Unless there is a massive change in the Discord application itself or 
bad actors within a specific Discord server that chooses to delete a server's messages, the data itself is secure and safe
from external tampering. Although the data in the GitHub repository is downloadable by anybody, Nathan reserves the right
to alter the data that is displayed in the repository itself as I am the repository's owner.
