**Assignment 2 Dataset**

Two csv files are provided

1. Assignment2_Data.csv
2. Assignment2_MetaData.txt

that contain the Discord Message dataset and its corresponding metadata respectively.

Collection Process:

As of this moment, the scraping process for collecting discord messages is executed entirely through my
personal Discord bot. Ideally, an application other than a Discord Bot would be performing this scraping process
as there is some significant overhead when bots perform operations versus regular third-party applications.

Thus, since the code that runs the Discord bot is not publicaly available (I still have to clean some secrets up),
the script for scraping discord data will not be released yet.
